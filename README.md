# Unseaworthy

A mod that makes boats unsuitable for ocean voyages.

This mod makes vanilla minecraft boats unseaworthy. They operate normally on rivers and near shorelines, but as soon as
they enter an ocean biome, they begin to be tossed by the sea and eventually break apart.

## Features

- Boats deployed on water begin shaking and bouncing upon entering ocean biomes (any biome in the `c:is_ocean`  biome
  tag).
- Five seconds later, they are smashed to pieces.
- They drop a few planks of the appropriate wood type and a few sticks.

## Why would you want that?

I needed a way to encourage players to build actual ships in a mod pack that is all about ocean voyages. Boats are too
good, so I made them worse.
